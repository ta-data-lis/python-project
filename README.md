# Project: Surreal EscaPY

## Overview

If you happen to know [Zork I: The Great Underground Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) ...congrats! (wow, you must be older than time :wink:). 

Text-based adventure games have inspired gaming development since 1977. Our goal for the first team project ([Aris Goulas](https://github.com/ArisGoulas), [Let√≠cia De Marchi](https://github.com/leticiademarchiferreira), [Matheus Freire](https://github.com/MatheusFreir)) was to use our newly-acquired Python programming skills, in order to develop further the design of a classic game - _Escape Room_ that was provided to us. We therefore present you the **Surreal EscaPY**!

---

## Game Design

Our development consists of 3 (and a half) features:
- :fearful: Environment thematic customization: _surreal nightmare_ - personalization of the experience (MVP)
- :mag: _"check"_ action addition - gameplay (towards a future "inventory" feature)
- :repeat: Map layout _differentiation_ - replayability (towards a future map layout "randomization" feature and a "random spawn location" feature)
- :hourglass: Player name & _Timer_ introduction - gameplay (towards a future "scoreboard" feature and a "lose condition" feature)

The Python modules `time` and `random` were used, together with an implementation of an additional function (explore_self).

### Game Map

### Game Narratives

The player is asked to provide a name, and then the game starts in a specific room. They can utilize a menu of three **actions** ("explore", "check", or "examine") in order to advancer in the game:
- Explore: indicates the room they currently are, the furniture and the doors present
- Check: lists the keys that they have collected
- Examine: allows them to inspect furniture in order to find keys, and, if applied to doors while in presence of the respective key, grants access through the door (yes/no option)

The customized rooms, furnitures, doors and keys that the player can encounter in the game are:
- 4+1 rooms: the room of insomnia, diamond room, the room of Alice, the room of reasoning, outside **(victory condition)**
- 6 furnitures: bed of nails, escritoire desk, steel chest, Red Queen bed, White Knight dresser, bag of problems
- 4 doors: veil of darkness, black hole, open mouth, arch of life
- 4 keys: candle-light, diamond, small pill , large pill **(random assignment)**

## How to play the Game

1. Clone this repo in your GitHub

2. Launch `surreal_escapy.py` (in command prompt, type `python surreal_escape.py`)

3. If you enjoyed, you might want to ~~take a break~~ :sparkles: spur your nostalgia further :sparkles: by checking some of the (successors of text-based) classic point-and-click adventure PC games I grew up with:
