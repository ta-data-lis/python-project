## Welcome To The Shire!

It’s time to play some old-school games! :video_game:

Ok, perhaps typing commands on your terminal is not your idea of fun, but we believe that adding **The Lord of The Rings** to the mix always helps. So, here’s a nerdy and retro option to consider after you finish binge-watching the latest season of Stranger Things. 


## Project Context

This (humble) Escape Game was our **very first Python project** as newbie programmers at Ironhack. 

We went from not having coded a line before, to making this work in **less than 72 hours** – that’s the pace at coding Bootcamps! 


## Game Narrative

>*Hurry up, hobbit!*

>*The Ring has awoken.
A threat grows in the land of Mordor where the shadows loom. **Find all maps** to reach Mount Doom and destroy the Ring once and for all.*

>*Your journey starts in The Shire.
You step out of Bilbo’s house… 
There’s no going back.*

>*You have **5 minutes** to solve the challenge.*

## What We Learned


-	Working with **dicts, lists, tuples**
-	**Conditional** statements and loops
-	**Functions**
-	Installing, importing **libraries** (e.g. time, termcolor)
-	… the adrenaline rush you feel when you make your code work! :surfer:


## Next Steps


With more time, we would have prioritized the following enhancements:

-	**New mini-games**.
-	Repurpose challenges and add **coding quizzes** to review the content of our classes (introduce **gamification** in the context of the bootcamp).
-	**Expand scope** with additional maps, characters and elements to interact with. 
-	Introduce **random** elements, so the experience is different every time you play.
